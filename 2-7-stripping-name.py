# Use a variable to represent a person’s name, and
# include some whitespace characters at the beginning and end of the name.
# Make sure you use each character combination, "\t" and "\n", at least once.
# Print the name once, so the whitespace around the name is displayed.
# Then print the name using each of the three stripping functions, lstrip(),
# rstrip(), and strip().


# *  person’s name
name = " erica "

print(name)

# ? lstrip()
print(name.lstrip())

# ? rstrip()
print(name.rstrip())

#?strip()
print(name.strip())


# ! character combination, "\t" and "\n"

print("\nErica")
print("\tErica")
