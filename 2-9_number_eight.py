# Write addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
# operations that each result in the number 8. Be sure to enclose your
# operations in print() calls to see the results. You should create four lines that
# look like this:
# * print(5+3)
# Your output should be four lines, with the number 8 appearing once on
# each line.

# * addition
print(4+4)

# *subtraction
print(10-2)

#* multiplication
print(2*4)

#*division
print(16/2)
